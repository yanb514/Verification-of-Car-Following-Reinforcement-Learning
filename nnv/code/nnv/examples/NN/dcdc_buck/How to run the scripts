% Simulink models used for training and testing

1. The "buck_pid.slx" is the simulink model used to train the neural network controller.

2. The "buck_nn.slx" is the simulink model where the PID controller is replaced by the trained neural network controller.

3. The "test_buck_pid.slx" and "test_buck_nn.slx" are used to generate the performance comparison of the original PID controller and the trained neural network controller.


% Run the scripts


1. First run "buck_parameters.m" to load the Buck converter parameters, simulate pid model, and generate data for training

2. To train the neural network controller, run script  "nnTrainController.m". This will also automatically generate the simulink block for the neural network controller

3. If you want to see the performance of the new generated NN controller, replace the neural network controller block in "buck_nn.slx" with the new generated neural network controller block 

4. To compare the neural network controller and the original PID controller, run "controller_comparison.m".
